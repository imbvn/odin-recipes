        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat lightly oil grate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk together <strong>egg, salt, and pepper</strong> in a medium bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add <strong>ground beef and bread crumbs</strong> and mix with your hands or fork until well blended.
            </li>
            <li>
                Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
            </li>

                Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
