        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Crispy</strong> on the outside and <em>juicy</em> on the inside, this homemade Tonkatsu (Japanese Pork Cutlet) is my favorite! I‘ll show you the secret to an <em>airy</em> breading that makes a light and supercrisp coating. Serve it with my tangy sesame dipping sauce and a refreshing shredded cabbage salad for a satisfying meal.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                Use a sharp knife to remove and discard the extra fat from your <strong>pork loin chops</strong>. Then, make several slits on the connective tissue between the meat and fat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip the meat and make several slits on the other side of the connective tissue.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pound both sides of the meat with the back of a knife or a meat tenderizer/mallet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mold the meat back into its original shape with your hands.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season both sides of the meat with <strong>kosher salt</strong> and <strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dredge the pork in the flour and dust off excess. Next, dip the pork into the egg mixture and coat well. Finally, dredge the pork in the fresh panko, gently pressing the panko onto the pork. Set aside for 5-10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add <strong>neutral oil</strong> to a pot and bring it to <u>340ºF (170ºC)</u> over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently put your pork into the oil and cook for <u>1 minute</u>. <strong>Don't touch the pork for 30 seconds</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                After a minute, flip the pork and cook the other side for 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take out the pork and remove excess oil. Let it sit for 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry your piece of pork a second time in <u>355ºF (180ºC)</u> for 30 seconds on each side. Let it rest for 2 minutes.
            </li>
